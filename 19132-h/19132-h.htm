and &ldquo;Banbury Cross,&rdquo; with its favourite juvenile
associations, with the Lady with bells on her toes, having music
wherever she goes, are indissolubly connected with the early years not
only of ourselves but many prior generations. In fact, the Ancient Cross
has been rebuilt since the days, when in Drunken Barnaby&rsquo;s
Journal, we are made familiar with the puritan &ldquo;who hanged his cat
on a Monday for killing of a mouse on a Sunday.&rdquo; The quaint old
town and its people are rapidly modernizing; but they cling to the old
traditions. Both in pictorial and legendary lore we have some Banburies
of another kind altogether, viz., Banbury Blocks, or in plain English,
Engraved Woodcut Blocks, associated with the Local Chap Books, Toy
Books, and other Histories, for which this quaint old Oxfordshire town
is celebrated. The faithful description of the Blocks illustrating this
volume has led to numerous descriptive digressions, apparently
irrelevant to the subject; it was found however that in tracing out the
former history and use of some of the &ldquo;Bewick&rdquo; and other
cuts contained in this volume, that the Literary, Artistic, Historical,
Topographical, Typographical, and Antiquarian Reminiscences connected
with the early Printing and Engraving of Banbury involved that of many
other important towns and counties of Great Britain, and also America. A
provincial publisher about the beginning of the present century would
reflect more or less the modus operandi of each of his contemporaries in
abridging or reproducing verbatim the immortal little chap books issued
from the press of John Newbury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Toy Book
Manufactory,&rdquo; at the Bible and Sun (a&nbsp;sign lately restored),
65, Saint Paul&rsquo;s Church Yard, near the&nbsp;Bar.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<!--png 005-->
This again leads to the subject as to who wrote these clever little
tomes. In my &ldquo;Angler&rsquo;s Garland,&rdquo; printed at the Dryden
Press, 1870 and 1871, I fully announced my intention of issuing a
reprint of the first edition of &ldquo;Goody Two Shoes,&rdquo; but the
intended volume was published by the firm at the corner,
&ldquo;Griffith, Farren, Okenden, and Welsh,&rdquo; now in the direct
line of business descent from worthy and industrious John Newbery:
Carman, Harris, Grant and Griffith. Mr. Charles Welsh of the present
firm has taken a warm interest in the Antiquarian and Historical
Associations of the Newbery firm. The premises have been lately rebuilt,
the Sign and Emblems adopted by Newbery restored, and C. Welsh has
reprinted &ldquo;Goody Two Shoes&rdquo; in facsimile, since which there
has been added to it a Standard edition of Goldsmith&rsquo;s Works,
edited by Mr. Gibbs. I had the pleasure of making many researches
respecting the old London publisher (Goldsmith&rsquo;s friend), John
Newbery, respecting his Lilliputian Classics, and I have been enabled to
introduce several of the Quarto early editions to the firm, and have had
great pleasure in writing and placing on record numerous facts and data,
since utilized in the very interesting &ldquo;Life of John Newbery, a
last century bookseller.&rdquo; The connection of Oliver
Goldsmith&rsquo;s name is indissolubly associated with the juvenile
classics industriously issued by Newbery. Dr. Johnson himself edited and
prefaced several children&rsquo;s books which I have seen in the Jupp
and Hugo Collections. The weary hours of adversity, through which
&ldquo;Goldie&rdquo; passed at Green Arbour Court, top of Break Neck
Steps and Turn Again Lane&mdash;I remember them all well, and the Fleet
prison walls too, when I was a boy&mdash;and in refuge at Canonbury
Tower, near the village of Islington, these are the places where
Goldsmith wrote for children. Sir Joshua Reynolds tells how, when he
called on the poet at Green Arbour Court, he found the
couplet:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse first">
&ldquo;By sports like these are all their cares beguiled,<br>
The sports of children satisfy the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
see &ldquo;The Traveller.&rdquo; He was surrounded by children in this
unsavoury neighbourhood, where he had his humble domicile: a woodcut in
Lumburd&rsquo;s Mirror depicts it very correctly. Bishop Percy, author
of the &ldquo;Reliques,&rdquo; called on him, and during the interview
the oft repeated incident occurred of a little child of an adjacent
neighbour, &ldquo;Would Mr. Goldsmith oblige her mother with a chamber
pot full of coals!&rdquo; Truly these were hours of ill-at-ease. The
largest collection of the various relics of woodcuts used in the chap
book literature, &ldquo;printed for the Company of Flying Stationers,
also Walking Stationers,&rdquo;&mdash;for such is a portion of the
imprint to be found on several of the early Chap Books printed at
Banbury&mdash;is to be seen in the Library of the British Museum; but
the richest collection of these celebrated little rarities <ins class =

Toy Books is in the venerable Bodleian Library. Among the very
interesting block relics of the past are the pretty cuts to Mrs.
Trimmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fabulous Histories, or The Robins:&rdquo; these
were designed by Thomas Bewick, and engraved by John Thompson, his
pupil, who enriched Whittingham&rsquo;s celebrated Chiswick Press with
his fine and tasteful work. A numerous series of little fable cuts by
the same artist are to be found in this volume. One of the quaintest
sets engraved at an early period by John Bewick (the Hogarth of
Newcastle), are to &ldquo;The Hermit, or Adventures of Edward
Dorrington,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Philip Quarll,&rdquo; as it was most
popularly known by that title a century ago. The earliest edition I have
seen of Philip Quarll is as follows: &ldquo;The Hermit, or the
unparalleled sufferings and surprising adventures of Mr. Philip Quarll,
an Englishman who was lately discovered by Mr. Dorrington, a Bristol
merchant, upon an uninhabited island in the South Sea, where he lived
above fifty years without any human assistance, still continues to
reside, and will not come away,&rdquo; etc. Westminster: Printed by J.
Cluer and A. Campbell, for T. Warner in Paternoster Row, and B. Creape
at The Bible in Jermyn Street, St. James&rsquo;s, 1727. 8vo, xii pp.,
map and explanation, 2 pp., and 1 to 26 appendix, with full page copper
plate engravings. He was born in St. Giles&rsquo;, left his master a
locksmith, went to sea, married a famous w&mdash;&mdash;e, listed for a
soldier, married three wives, condemned at the Old Bailey, pardoned by
King Charles II., turned merchant, and was shipwrecked on a desolate
island on the coast of Mexico, etc. Other editions in the British Museum
are 1750; 1759 (third); 1780 (twelfth); 1786 (first American edition,
from the 6th English edition, Boston, U.S.A.); 1787 (in&nbsp;French);
1795 (seventeenth); 1807; and also in a &ldquo;Storehouse of
Stories,&rdquo; edited by Miss C.&nbsp;M. Yonge, 2 vols, 8vo (Macmillan,
1870-2), Philip Quarll (also Perambulations of a Mouse, Little Jack,
Goody Two Shoes, Blossoms of Morality, Puzzle for a curious Girl<ins
class = "correction" title =
"close parenthesis missing: here or at end of sentence?">), </ins>and
others are given. The text is useful to refer to, as the originals are
rare: the woodcuts of several of them are in this volume. &ldquo;Philip
Quarll,&rdquo; Miss Yonge says, &ldquo;comes to us with the reputation
of being by Daniel Defoe; but we have never found anything to warrant
the supposition. It must have been written during the period preceding
the first French Revolution.&rdquo; There is also in the Museum an
edition printed in Dutch in 1805.</p>

<p>
In 1869, Mr. Wm. Tegg reprinted the Surprising Adventures of Philip
Quarll, entirely re-edited and modernized, with only a frontispiece and
vignette on title as illustrations. The quaint old cuts on next page
probably illustrated an early Newcastle, then York, and finally Banbury,
edition of this oft published work.</p>

<p>Tegg&rsquo;s edition of 356 pages, 12mo, is to be seen in the Reading
Room of the British Museum, and gives the full text and history of
these. This curious book would well bear representing with the original
Bewick cuts, after the manner of the present Newbery firm, who have
revived Butterfly&rsquo;s Ball, Grasshopper&rsquo;s Feast, Goody Two
Shoes, Looking Glass for the Mind, and contemplate others in the
immediate future. Tegg in his reprint
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>

of the Book on Philip Quarll, states that he was born in St.
Giles&rsquo; Parish, London, 1647, voyaged to Brazil, Mexico, and other
parts of America, was left on an island, nourished by a goat, and other
surprising adventures. Edward Dorrington communicates an account (see
p.&nbsp;1 to 94 inclusive) of how the hermit Philip Quarll was
discovered, with his (E.&nbsp;D.&rsquo;s) return to Bristol from Mexico,
Jan. 3, 1724-5; but is about returning to Peru and Mexico again
(p.&nbsp;94). This is of both American and Bewick interest. Besides
these representatives of this Chap Book, we are enabled to give in this
collection impressions from the blocks of other editions fortunately
rescued from oblivion and destruction.</p>

York, established himself as a printer in Newcastle-on-Tyne, bringing
with him a stock of quaint old cuts, formerly his father&rsquo;s, at
York, where he was Sole Printer to King William, for the five Northern
Counties of England. He entered into partnership with Thomas Saint, who
on the death of John White, at their Printing Office in Pilgrim Street,
succeeded in 1796 to his extensive business as Printer, Bookseller, and
Publisher. In this stock of woodcuts were some of the veritable pieces
of wood engraved, or cut for Caxton, Wynken de Worde, Pynson, and others
down to Tommy Gent&mdash;the curious genius, historian, author, poet,
<ins class = "correction" title = "so in original">woodcuter</ins> and
engraver, binder and printer, of York. We give some early examples out
of this stock. Thomas Saint, about 1770, had the honour of introducing
to the public, the brothers Thomas and John Bewick&rsquo;s first efforts
in wood-engravings, early and crude as they undoubtedly were. They are
to be found in Hutton &ldquo;On Mensuration,&rdquo; and also in various
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
children&rsquo;s and juvenile works, such as Æsop&rsquo;s and
Gay&rsquo;s Fables. We give some of the earliest known of their work in
this very interesting collection of woodcuts.</p>

<p>
Some years ago a collection was formed of Newbury and Marshall&rsquo;s
Children&rsquo;s Gift Toy Books, and early educational works, which were
placed in the South Kensington Museum, in several glass cases. These
attracted other collections of rare little volumes, adorned with similar
cuts, many of which are from the identical blocks here impressed,
notably the &ldquo;Cries of York,&rdquo; &ldquo;Goody Two Shoes,&rdquo;
etc. They are still on view, near the George Cruikshank collection, and
during the twenty years they have been exhibited, such literature has
steadily gone up to fancy prices.</p>

<p>
Charles Knight in his Shadows of the Old Booksellers, says of Newbury,
(pp. 233), &ldquo;This old bookseller is a very old friend of mine. He
wound himself round my heart some seventy years ago, when I became
possessed of an immortal volume, entitled the history of &lsquo;Little
Goody Shoes.&rsquo; I felt myself personally honoured in the
dedication.&rdquo; He then refers to Dr. Primrose, Thomas Trip, etc.,
and adds further on, &ldquo;my father had a drawer full of them
[Newbury&rsquo;s little books] very smartly bound in gilt paper.&rdquo;
Priceless now would this collection be, mixed up with horn-books&mdash;a
single copy of which is one of the rarest relics of the olden time.</p>

<p>
<ins class = "correction" title = "so in original">Chalmer&rsquo;s</ins>
in his preface to &ldquo;Idler,&rdquo; regards Mr. Newbury as the
reputed author of many little chap books for masters and misses.</p>

<p>
Mr. John Nichols brings forward other candidates for the honour of
projecting and writing the &ldquo;Lilliputian histories, of Goody Two
Shoes, etc.;&rdquo; and refers to Griffith Jones and Giles Jones, in
conjunction with Mr. John Newbury, as those to whom the public are
indebted for the origin of those numerous and popular little books for
the amusement and instruction of children, which have ever since been
received with universal approbation.</p>

<p>
The following are two of the identical cuts engraved by John Bewick, and
used in the Newbury editions of Goody Two Shoes, London, 1769 to
1771.</p>

It will be seen on contrasting these cuts with the other two, on the
following page, from early York editions, how wonderfully even in his
early years Bewick improved the
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
illustrated juvenile literature of his day. No wonder when Goldsmith the
poet had an interview with Bewick, that delighted with his cuts, he
confessed to writing Goody Two Shoes, Tommy Trip, etc. Bewick&rsquo;s
daughter supplied this information.</p>

There was an American edition of Goody Two Shoes, and is very
interesting indeed, having a woodcut frontispiece engraved by Thomas
Bewick, and was printed at Worcester, Mass., U.S.A., by Isaiah Thomas,
and sold wholesale and retail at his book-store, 1787. A copy of this
little book sold in London for £1&nbsp;16s.</p>

The packmen of the past [see frontispiece of a pack-horse in First
Edition only of Bewick&rsquo;s Quadrupeds, 1790] carried in their packs
the ephemeral literature of the day, Calendars, Almanacks, and <ins

Leicestershire pronunciation to this day at markets is &ldquo;Buy
Chep<ins class = "correction" title =

hence the Chep-side, or Cheape-or
Cheapside; otherwise derivation of Chap Men, or Running, Flying, and
other mercurial stationers, peripatetic booksellers, pedlers, packmen,
and again chepmen, these visited the villages and small towns from the
large printers of the supply towns, as London, Banbury, Newcastle,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, etc. The &ldquo;History of John Cheap, the
Chapman,&rdquo; &ldquo;Parley the Porter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stephen of
Salisbury Plain,&rdquo; and other favourite tracts, with John
Bewick&rsquo;s and Lee&rsquo;s square woodcuts were written by the
quaker lady, Hannah More, about 1777, and were first published in
broadsheet folio. Some were done by Hazzard, of Bath, others by
Marshall, of Bow Lane, Aldermary Church Yard. A most curious collection
of chap books did they print, reviving the quaint old &ldquo;Blind
Beggar of Bethnal Green,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guy, Earl of Warwick,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seven Champions,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother Shipton&rsquo;s Life and
Prophecies,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wise Men of <ins class = "correction" title =

The &ldquo;Memoirs of a Peg Top,&rdquo; &ldquo;Perambulations of a

works, some by Mrs. Trimmer, under various pseudonyms, were published in

<p>
Hazzard, printer of Bath, who published many works for Dr. J. Trusler,
with woodcuts by John Bewick, Lee, and others, also published the cheap

All the following little wood blocks were used in several toy books,

1814, in Dutch flowery and gingerbread gilt paper binding, just like

<p>
In Blade&rsquo;s Life of Caxton, the reader will find interesting
examples of the earliest woodcut blocks illustrating the quaint and rare
tomes issued by the Almonry, Westminster, also at Oxford. The Robin Hood
Garland blocks (circa 1680 or earlier), is one of the earliest
provincial blocks with a distinct history. We can trace them in varied
collections used by early London and Provincial printers, and in the
London Bridge printed Chap Book Literature.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
Sutton, printer of Nottingham, issued a curious quarto volume of old
woodcuts. He was descended from the celebrated T. Sutton, who founded
the Charterhouse. Some twenty-five years ago I went over the very quaint
collection with the proprietor, and suggested a volume being issued, but
the idea had already been matured by&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>
Robert White, the poet and local historian of Newcastle upon
Tyne&mdash;by whose favour I reprinted Tommy Trip in 1867&mdash;has one
of the choicest, most comprehensive, and rarest libraries of local
stories, garlands, ballads, and chap books, and North country folk-lore
children&rsquo;s books, almanacks, primers,
&ldquo;A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C.,&rdquo; horn books, battledores, etc., that
were ever gathered together. I am glad to place on record, that by his
will, his collection will remain intact. The special opportunities
afforded him at the time for collecting them have entirely passed
away.</p>

<p>
I believe he was descended from John White, printer for the five
northern counties of England to King William. This is referred to by Mr.
Dodd in his preface to a quarto volume of woodcut impressions. William
Dodd fully appreciated the local interest, by producing a limited
impression of the quaint blocks in his possession.</p>

<p>
The Rev. Mr. Hugo had a very large and important collection of blocks
and books, and at his death I arranged and catalogued them for Messrs.
Sotheby, according to the wish of his widow. The Rev. gentleman had
wished his collection to be purchased by the trustees of the British
Museum, but some little hitch occurred and this was not accomplished. In
his collection the Robin Hood block, perforated with worm holes,
realized quite a fancy price.</p>

<p>
Among the relics of ancient woodcutting, are some so early and crude in
their execution&mdash;quaint as the period they illustrate&mdash;as to
really entitle them to the literal name and meaning of <i>woodcuts</i>,
rather than wood-engravings, which they really became in the hands of
the two Bewicks and their numerous school of pupils. Other provincial
publishers were not so favoured as those at Newcastle-on-Tyne, as to
have a Bewick trying his prentice hand on similar series, as used by J.
Bell and others.</p>

<p>
The Cock Robin blocks in this collection are certainly the earliest
series I have seen among the thousands I have examined. The York Cries,
Tom Hickethrift, Jack the Giant Killer, and many kindred cuts, are
evidently from the collection of John White, the early printer, and are
as quaint, as funny and droll in crudity of execution, as any of Thomas
Gent&rsquo;s, the unique York engraver and bookseller.</p>

<p>
The rarity and interest of a collection like the present, with their
varied associations, may be fairly estimated when we consider that the
country printers in those days were not particular in making the same
woodcut do duty in most <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original">incongrous</ins> and inapplicable positions and
subjects.</p>

<p>
We have met with a block in a child&rsquo;s book, then the identical
woodcut on a ballad, catchpenny, or last dying speech and confession,
setting at defiance any suitability of illustration,
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
or adaptability to the text matter. Of course now, some of these
examples are exceedingly ludicrous, and do not fail to excite merriment,
and often add to the intrinsic value of the article, as may be judged by
numerous examples that have occurred in our literary auction marts
during the last half century.</p>

<p>
Besides it must be taken fair notice of that a genuine wood-engraving,
or woodcut block may soon become a curiosity of the past, owing to the
improved methods of illustrating children&rsquo;s books. Many of
Bewick&rsquo;s blocks are veritable paintings on boxwood, and are as
much classical works of art as work by Josiah Wedgwood, and his able
coadjutor, J. Flaxman are in Fine Art. These early crude, quaint, droll
little pioneer wood blocks will ever remain of great and even historical
interest as showing the progress and influence on the illustrated
literature of the civilized world.</p>

<p>
Many of our readers have heard of Banbury Cross and Banbury cakes, and
other famous juvenile associations, as the lady with bells on her toes,
but it was also connected with the production of books for juvenile
readers. A great portion of the blocks in this volume are Banbury blocks
used for illustrating the toy books, children&rsquo;s histories, etc.,
for which this quaint old Oxfordshire town was famous. Many of them are
connected with the early printing and engraving carried on in this and
other towns of England. A quantity of the blocks were used in the books
printed by John White of York, who established himself, as before
mentioned, as a printer in Newcastle-on-Tyne, bringing with him a stock
of quaint old blocks formerly his father&rsquo;s [at York], where he was
sole printer to King William, for the five northern counties of
England.</p>

<p>
Boswell has recorded several conversations of Oliver Goldsmith with Dr.
Johnson, in which the warm-hearted poet expressed a wish, &ldquo;to make
fishes, animals, birds, etc., <i>talk</i>, or appear so to do, for the
amusement and instruction of children.&rdquo; In the National Collection
is &ldquo;The Valentine&rsquo;s Gift, or a Plan to enable children of
all sizes and denomination to behave with honour, integrity, and
humanity, very necessary to a trading nation: to which is added some
account of Old Zigzag, and of the Horn with which he used to understand
the language of birds, beasts, fishes and insects,&rdquo; etc.,

Most of the latter except &ldquo;Vicar&rdquo; formed a circle of the

nobleman, by &ldquo;John Newbery.&rdquo; The size was
&ldquo;snuffbox,&rdquo; or

Scandal,&rdquo; etc., Costume, etc.) Documentary evidence and receipts
in Goldsmith&rsquo;s handwriting, acknowledging various sums for writing
the &ldquo;Rhetorick,&rdquo; and others of the above exist. Goldsmith
also did numerous Abridgements of the Old and New Testaments, Robinson
Crusoe, Pamela, Clarissa Harlow, Sir Chas. Grandison, all in this
juvenile series for J. Newbery.</p>

This was a most popular juvenile brochure, at end of eighteenth century.
The early editions of J. Bunyan&rsquo;s Works, 2 vols, folio, had the
Divine Emblems at end of vol 2, with quaint old woodcuts. These were
industriously copied in reduced sizes, and published from 1d. to 6d., by
various London and Provincial &ldquo;toy book&rdquo; manufacturers. The

Providing ourselves with a variety of pens and ink, we select two of the
best and proceed to describe the Banbury Printer&rsquo;s old stock of
cuts.</p>

<p>
Banbury, Oxfordshire, was one of the chief provincial towns noted for
its Children&rsquo;s Books, Chap Books, <ins class = "correction" title
= "so in original">Battledoes</ins>, Reading Easies, etc., also for
locally printed works,
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
notably for two, viz., Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Rasselas</i>, and White
and Beesley&rsquo;s <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads 'workon'">work on</ins> <i>Bees</i>,
thin 12mo volumes, boards, printed
in a curious phonetic character, called &ldquo;Rusher&rsquo;s
Types.&rdquo; Rusher, printer of this town, had some ingenuity and
originality of his own, and was not such a plagiarist and imitator as
some of his contemporaries. Many of the tales he cleverly adapted to the
locality, which have become very valuable. His edition of the Rasselas
realized £5 5s. This book was written by Johnson in a week to defray his
mother&rsquo;s funeral expenses.</p>

<p>
We give several extracts from some of Rusher&rsquo;s Penny Books which
will show how well he adapted them to his town.</p>

<h5>HISTORY OF A BANBURY CAKE.</h5>

<p>
I was born or made (whichever you please, my little reader) at Banbury
in the county of Oxford, as you can plainly conceive by my title, where
great numbers of Cakes are brought into being daily; and from whence
they travel by coach, chaise, waggon, cart horse and foot into all parts
of this Kingdom: nay and beyond the seas, as I heard my maker declare
that he had, more then once sent some of them into France.</p>

<p>
Soon after I was made, and while I was yet warm from the oven, I was
sold by my maker&rsquo;s fair daughter to a person on horseback for
twopence.</p>

<p>
With this person I took my first journey to Oxford; he rode a very fine
Black Horse. As soon as he came home, he gave me to his son a lovely
little boy, about seven years of age, and one as I found to my comfort
not only lovely in person but in temper also. His name was Tommy, and he
was praised and loved by all that knew him, and had often presents of
cakes, toys and little books, and other things that are proper for
children of his age; the books he kept with great care as things of
value and worthy of his notice, but other trinkets he seemed to
despise.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
Tommy and his cousin were taken to see Mr. Polito&rsquo;s collection of
wild beasts and birds, which were then exhibiting at Oxford, among which
were a large lion, an eagle, and many other natural curiosities, which
sight was very entertaining, as Tommy and his cousin had never seen such
before. They afterwards walked into the Colleges, round Christ Church
College Meadow, and indeed saw all the curiosities about Oxford.</p>

&ldquo;The Cries of York, for the amusement of Young Children, decorated
with cuts printed by T. Kendrew, Collier Gate, York.&rdquo; These York
Cries have not been mentioned by any writer on juvenile literature and
the same may be said of the Banbury Cries. T. Kendrew of York, brought
out many interesting penny and other children&rsquo;s books. He
published &ldquo;Giles Gingerbread, a little boy who lived upon
learning, by Tom Trip,&rdquo; this was an abbreviation of <ins class =
"correction" title = "so in original">Newberry&rsquo;s</ins> Edition of
the <ins class = "correction" title =
"original has single quote">&ldquo;</ins>Silver Penny.&rdquo;
The series was illustrated with
the early and prentice work of the Bewick School. One of the rarest is
&ldquo;The Cries of York,&rdquo; the cuts of which afterwards travelled
to Banbury and appeared in &ldquo;Banbury Cries.&rdquo; The series we
are enabled to give complete.</p>

<p>The Cries of York is distinctly different from The Cries of London
issued by Kendrew though the same set of Cuts are utilized.</p>

<p>
London Street Cries have always had a fascination peculiarly their own.
Madame Vestris used to bring down the house with &ldquo;Cherry
Ripe,&rdquo; and where are happier efforts of the favourite home Artists
than &ldquo;London Cries&rdquo; by A. Morland, Wheatley, Stodhard, and
others, which are so eagerly sought after by connoiseurs? The pretty
plaintive Cries too, would we had the &lsquo;music&rsquo; to them, so
familiar in the streets in those charming old English days.</p>

A most interesting and quaint old relic is the one from which annexed
impression is
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
given, from Dyche&rsquo;s Spelling Book: an exceedingly clean, choice
and crisp copy of this book, in the original sheep covers,&mdash;a
veritable &ldquo;old shopkeeper,&rdquo; which for nearly a century had
escaped its intended destiny in Rusher&rsquo;s varied stores, at length
found a resting place in Sir Thomas Bodley&rsquo;s venerable receptacle
for bibliographical treasures in the Bodelian, Oxford. The present
example&mdash;a portion of which was broken away many years
ago,&mdash;is probably the sole surviving one of the quaint series of
cuts, doubtless admired by our great-grand-parents over 100
years&nbsp;ago.</p>

<p>A Gentleman wrote to one of the newspapers some time ago, detailing a
curious incident that happened to himself, showing how these very
interesting prints and blocks are being scattered and destroyed. He says
&ldquo;In the old days when Catnach was King of the ballad world, boys
used to steal the woodblocks of Mr. Bewick the wood-cutter, and sell
them to the great song singer. Yesterday, for a halfpenny, I picked up
in a bye street in London one of the prints of a very beautiful block of
this kind heading a song called &lsquo;The Wealthy Farmer&rsquo;s
Son.&rsquo; I wonder whether anybody has ever thought it worth while to
collect these pictures.&rdquo; This interesting pursuit of collecting
and illustrating with extra cuts, pages of child book literature of the
17th, 18th, and early 19th century, would indeed be a charming
recreation. On this subject there appeared a long article in the
Graphic, where the writer says, under the initials
&lsquo;C.&nbsp;H.,&rsquo; &ldquo;There are few more agreeable
occupations for anyone who has sufficient leisure at his disposal, than
that of embellishing a favourite book with illustrations appropriate to
the subject, and thereby endowing it with additional interest and value.
To those who cultivate this fascinating pursuit with taste and
intelligence,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
there are two indispensible conditions of success. The task of
collecting the materials is a labour of love, and every fresh discovery
in some out-of-the-way corner, of a long-sought desideratum, a delight
which the patience and industrious enthusiast alone can
appreciate.&rdquo; Then follows much genial advice on tasteful and
judicious collecting, and how to illustrate. In the present case the
interest and value could only be realized or conceived on the completion
of a choice collection of extra cuts, and cuttings of articles,
portraits, views, autograph letters, etc., carefully mounted on
cartridge paper, paged to correspond with the text, and then handed to a
judicious binder&mdash;this is a very important item&mdash;who would
carefully encase it, and make it form a select and an exceptionibly
valuable addition to the library.</p>

That this interesting idea may not be considered unworthy of
adoption&mdash;<ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original: 'to which'?">which</ins> by the way the few large paper
copies of this book are admirably <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original: 'adapted'?">adopted</ins>&mdash;we give a short
list of those who have collected and treasured with care these little
brochures. In the South Kensington Museum on exhibition, is a collection
of Horn Books and Battledores, exhibited by Kenneth, R.&nbsp;H.
Mackenzie, Esq., <i>F.S.A.,</i> who read a paper on this subject before
the Society of Antiquaries. There is another collection which includes
many curious Horn Books or Battledores, from circa 1750, 1784, 1800 to
1810, including photo and facsimiles of one of the Middleton Horn Books
now in the Bateman Museum. There is also a curious poem on the Horn Book
by a Gent. suffering from the gout, printed at Dublin by T. Cowan, 1728,
small 4to, only a few leaves. Another very neat Horn Book with the Horn
in front, hence its name, is also on view. The scarcity of these quaint
early educational books may be understood from the fact that Mr. Hone,
author of the Every Day Book, etc., sought for an original Horn Book for
years without success. Mr. Coleridge had one or two cases on
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
exhibition, with numerous examples of Newbury and Marshall&rsquo;s
little books, but we believe these are withdrawn. There is also a
selection of early educational books; but the largest collection formed
is still on exhibition. In conclusion, it may be said that the present
volume contains many precious relics of the Bewick, Newbury, Goldsmith,
Newcastle York, Banbury, Coventry, and Catnach presses, and a
representative collection of the stock of workable woodcuts of a
provincial printer in the latter part of the 18th century, and to those
who would like to inspect the rentable copies of those valuable and
interesting little books, and some of the original Horn Books, etc., let
them see the Coleridge, Kenneth Mackenzie, and Pearson collections in
the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, there appeared in the catalogue of books
belonging to William Bell Scott, Esq., recently sold at Messrs. Sotheby,
a small 4to Album containing a collection of wood engravings by Bewick,
Clennell, and others, which with some newspaper cuttings made quite a
dainty extra illustrated volume.</p>

<p>If so eminent an artist could find pleasure and recreation in this
pursuit, others may certainly rely upon finding it equally attractive,
but he would have found his task much easier if he had had a large paper

<h5>BANBURY FAIR.</h5>

<p>
<span class = "smallcaps">About</span> 1820, many curious Tracts were
issued by various Societies with the illustrations which follow. Some of
these Tracts relating to Social and Religious questions of that day had
been edited by Hannah More and her sister&mdash;at &ldquo;Barley
Wood,&rdquo; near Bath&mdash;also by Rowland Hill, the eccentric divine
of old Surrey Chapel, and others; these are now quite ephemeral literary
productions, notably some on the &ldquo;Sunday Question.&rdquo; Several
of the following cuts were used contemporary with Timothy Spagg&rsquo;s
(Charles Dickens&rsquo;s) Sunday Under Three Heads. One of these, an 8vo
pamphlet, has on the title, a large woodcut by Thomas Bewick,
commencing;&mdash;<i>Here we have Bewick, I declare</i>, etc. Many of
the original cuts to the Bristol series of Tracts issued from 1805 to
1820 are in this volume.</p>

<h5>DROLLERIES OF THE STEAM ENGINE.</h5>

<p>When Steam was first introduced it naturally called forth much
&lsquo;text&rsquo; and illustration. The <ins class = "correction" title
= "so in original, but illustrations were printed below">above</ins> we
believe to be designed by &lsquo;Cromek.&rsquo; Miss Bewick spoke highly
of him; he was one of the &lsquo;Boys&rsquo; or pupils in Bewick&rsquo;s
School. He executed some choice vignettes for &lsquo;Burns&rsquo;s
Poems,&rsquo; much in Luke Clennell&rsquo;s style, Bewick&rsquo;s
favourite pupil.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
